# Development

1. Experiment with relaxed clock parameters.
    - slack: 0.1 # Better
1. Experiment with marginal likelihood parameters.
    - branch_length_mode: marginal
    - time_marginal: assign
1. Experiment with the coalescent parameters.
    - Tc: Skyline
1. Catch bad lower confidence bounds.

## TO DO

1. Think about snippy_dir in rule ```eager```...
