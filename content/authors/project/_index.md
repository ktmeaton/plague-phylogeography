The Plague Phylogeography project contributes to our understanding of how and why epidemics of plague are related, with a particular focus on the Second Pandemic. By emphasizing the role that digital exhibits play, this work opens up new avenues for the integration of multidisciplinary sources, collaborative exchange, and pedagogical approaches to the study of medieval plague.
